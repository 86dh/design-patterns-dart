## Contributor's Guide

We appreciate any help, whether it's a simple fix of a typo or a whole new example. Just [make a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), do your change and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

Here's a style guide which might help you to keep your changes consistent with our code:

1. All code should meet the [Effective Dart: Style](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
 
2. Use [Dart Format](https://dart.dev/tools/dart-format) or auto format shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + L` in your ide. 

3. Try to hard wrap the code at 80th's character. It helps to list the code on the website without scrollbars.

4. File names should match following convention: `some_class_name.dart`

5. Comments may or may not have language tags in them, such as this:

    ```dart
    /**
     * EN: All products families have the same varieties (MacOS/Windows).
     *
     * This is a MacOS variant of a button.
     *
     * RU: Все семейства продуктов имеют одни и те же вариации (MacOS/Windows).
     *
     * Это вариант кнопки под MacOS.
     */
    ```

    Don't be scared and ignore the non-English part of such comments. If you want to change something in a comment like this, then do it. Even if you do it wrong, we'll tell you how to fix it during the Pull Request.
